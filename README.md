# Jetski MVC framework for Ruby. Build websites faster

Whats faster a train or a jetski? Would you rather ride on a train or a jetski? 

This all depends on your preference but this is why I create the Jetski library for Ruby.

I wanted to see if I could create an alternative with a simpler and possibly faster approach and I realized I could do just that!
